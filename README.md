## Introduction
Huawei Video Editor Kit (Video Editor Kit) provided by Huawei to quickly build video editing capabilities. It provides two integration modes.

- Video editor UI SDK, which provides product-level UIs and easy integration.

- Video editor atomic capability SDK, which provides hundreds of underlying capability interfaces, including multiple AI algorithm capability interfaces, which can be flexibly selected based on service scenarios.

- Screen recorder demo provide basic usage of screen recording. There are functions demonstrating usage of start/stop recording and setting configuration.

- Template creation SDK, which provides the capability of creating and uploading templates.

Both modes provide one-stop video editing capabilities, such as import, editing, rendering, export, and media resource management. These two modes provide high-performance, easy-to-use, and highly compatible interfaces, helping you easily build applications.

## Running Procedure
- Clone the code base to the local host.

- If you haven't already registered as a developer, register and create an app on [AppGalleryConnect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html).
- Obtain the agconnect-services.json file from [HUAWEI Developers]([https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/Media-Guides/config-agc-0000001101108580](javascript:;)).
- Place the agconnect-services.json file in the root directory of the demo.
- If you need to use cloud-side service capabilities, you need to use the api_key value in agconnect-services.json to call MediaApplication.getInstance().setApiKey(String apiKey) during application initialization.
- Compile and run on an Android device or emulator.

Note:

The package name in this project cannot be used to apply for agconnect-services.json. You can use a customized package name to apply for agconnect-services.json.
You only need to change applicationId in application-level build.gradle to the same package name as the applied agconnect-services.json to experience Video Editor Kit services.

## Supported Environment
Android SDK 21 or later and JDK 1.8 or later are recommended.
